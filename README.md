GitHub Developer Profile Generator

This project is a Python implementation of a developer profile generator, created for an Object-Oriented Programming assignment.

Overview

The program creates a Profile class that represents a developer's profile with attributes and methods to display the information in a formatted way.

 Profile Class Attributes

- name: The developer's name (Anna-Swift)
- favorite_language: The preferred programming language (Python and French)
- hobby: Personal interest (reading)
- tech_stack: List of technologies the developer works with (Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- github_username: GitHub username (anntech54)
- fun_fact: An interesting personal fact (I once hiked to the top of a volcano!)

Methods

1. __init__(self): The constructor method that initializes all profile attributes with default values
2. introduce(self): Prints a greeting message combining name, favorite language, and hobby
3. show_stack(self): Displays the technologies in the developer's tech stack
4. github_link(self): Returns the complete URL to the developer's GitHub profile

How to Run

1. Save the code as profile.py
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the file location
4. Run: python profile.py

 Expected Output

The program will display a formatted developer profile showing the introduction, tech stack, GitHub link, and fun fact.
